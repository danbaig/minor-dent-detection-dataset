# Minor Dents Detection Dataset for Metal Surfaces (YOLO Format)

This dataset has been specially curated for the task of detecting **minor dents** on metallic car surfaces under various real-world conditions. It is designed to assist researchers and practitioners working on **automated damage detection**, especially in the automotive industry.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Overview

- **Total Images:** 2241
- **Train Images:** 1568
- **Validation Images:** 449
- **Test Images:** 224
- **Format:** YOLOv8 (Image files only; label files may be provided separately)

## ðŸ›  Data Collection

This dataset was meticulously collected by Muhammad Danish Zia Baig as part of a master's thesis project titled:

> "Minor Dents Detection of Metal Surfaces Using Deep Learning"

The images were captured **manually** in various environments:
- Local **workshops**
- **Public roads** and **urban areas**
- Cars with **hail damage** and other minor dents

To ensure authenticity and real-world application, this dataset includes:
- Natural lighting variability (sunlight, shadows, artificial lighting)
- Cars of different colors and surface reflectivity
- Multiple angles and scales of dents

## ðŸ§ª Preprocessing & Quality

Several preprocessing steps were applied to enhance dent visibility, including:
- Contrast adjustments
- Shadow normalization
- Cropping and noise reduction

This dataset stands out due to its **diversity and detail** in capturing minor dents, especially compared to existing datasets that often lack real-world conditions or focus on major damages only.
